### STEP 1 : RP2040 Firmware

In order to make use of the 1.14 lcd you would need to upload the firmware with the complied modules on it

* For this press boot button then plug to laptop/desktop after that release the button.
* You will now see a new storage device on your machine. 
* then drag and drop **firmware.uf2** file to RangePi

### STEP 2 : Loading python files To RangePi

for this project we will be using the Thorny IDE. A link to the IDE:
