## Demos Incuded

* 1 Transmitting - How to transmit data on the RangePi with and without the use of buttons 
* 2 Receiving - How to receive data on the the RangePi
* Template - A template py file to help get you started with the RangePi

## Mode Selection

### LoRa mode selection jumpers

* short M0, short M1: transmission mode (In this project we use transmission mode)
* short M0, open M1: configuration mode (You can configure the lora via this mode)
* open M0, short M1: WOR mode
* open M0, open M1: deep sleep mode

## Quick Start Guide

### Getting started with Range pi

A demonstration of many of the following steps will be shown in our getting started guide.

### STEP 1 : RP2040 Firmware

In order to make use of the 1.14 lcd you would need to upload the firmware with the complied modules on it

* For this press boot button then plug to laptop/desktop after that release the button.
* You will now see a new storage device on your machine. 
* then drag and drop **firmware.uf2** file to RangePi

### STEP 2 : Loading and Running python files To RangePi

for this project we will be using the Thorny IDE. A link to the IDE:

https://thonny.org/

#### Steps to load python file to RangePi

#### Step 1 - Open the target Python file in Thorny
